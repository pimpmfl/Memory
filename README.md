# Memory — G4T4

## What is Memory? 

Memory is a web application, that uses an algorithm to help you learn faster.
You can create your own decks and fill them with cards of your own. The cards can always be editted, as long as it's your deck. Not to mention that there's a section for all the public decks, that were created
by other users.  

### You want others to learn from your deck?
It's simple, you just have to click the 'Unlock' button and you're done. Everybody will be able to see it.
